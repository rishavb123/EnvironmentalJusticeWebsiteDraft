        <h2>About Environmental Justice</h2>

        <p class='text'>Georgia Tech is home to one of the most diverse student populations in the entire state of Georgia. Yellow Jackets come from all over 
            the world, and our common purpose to create the future is what unites us. Just like how Georgia Tech is home to us, Atlanta is home to Georgia 
            Tech. Members of the Atlanta community, predominantly poor African American families, suffer from the injustices of inequitable environmental 
            protection and regulation. As Yellow Jackets, if we are to build the future, it starts with building up the community around us by seeking 
            environmental justice.</p>

        <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>

        <p class='text'>The Environmental Justice movement was born out of the Civil Rights movement when Martin Luther King, Jr. lent his aid to the Sanitation Strike of 1968. The night before MLK’s assassination, he bravely told a 
            group of sanitation workers that “we’ve got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end.” Those fateful words would mark the beginning of a historic movement to ensure equity for all people in terms of environmental 
            protection. The year 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Environmental Justice movement, and though a lifetime of progress has been made to bring about environmental justice, we must remember that there is still a lot 
            of work left to do.</p>

        <h2>Why It Matters?</h2>

        <p class='text'>Environmental injustices in Atlanta should matter to Georgia Tech students for several reasons. Perhaps the most prominent reason is that we all live near the heart of Atlanta; whatever happens to the city, happens 
            to us. It is important that GT students care about their immediate surroundings. Looking at the maps on this page dealing with tree cover, income, and environmental status, there is a clear correlation between these factors. 
            The mission statement of Georgia Tech includes making a meaningful contribution to society, including our immediate surroundings. The overlap of the surrounding graphs makes it clear that certain areas of Atlanta are underserved 
            and suffering from poor environmental conditions. Students should care because these people are suffering all around us and as students of Georgia Tech, it is our duty to do whatever we can to help those suffering.</p>

                    Currently, one of the largest environmental justice issues facing Atlanta is air pollution. Impoverished communities tend

                    years with new ideas to combat this issue. Click the image to the left for more information.

                                <p>Air pollution is a large issue for many citizens around Atlanta and throughout all of Georgia that live below the 
                                    poverty line. Toxic gases from coal-fired power plants are produced all over EPA region 4, which includes Georgia. 
                                    African American communities suffer disproportionately from this issue due to their proximity to sources of pollution. 
                                    In 2011, the EPA proposed a plan to cut down on toxic emissions from coal-powered plants across the state. It is estimated that
                                    African American communities in Georgia are 30% more likely to be affected by a coal plant’s toxins than any other 
                                    community. It was estimated that this plan would save 17,000 lives and prevent over 100,000 cases of asthma. The 
                                    expected value of these improvements was around $100 billion a year. To put this in perspective, this article 
                                    states that for every dollar spent on this beneficial project, the average american citizen would see an increase of 
                                    around $10 in health benefits. This movement has been extraordinarily helpful to Georgians and people living in the 
                                    Atlanta area since Georgia is one of the top 5 states in number of coal-based power plants near low income communities. 
                                    New limitations on power plant location have also been established. New factories must be built a certain distance away 
                                    from any community to safeguard their health. This event can be seen as a great win for environmental justice. 
                                    Because the EPA brought this problem to the center stage, new laws have been created to help protect the right of 
                                    every person to equal health.</p>

                                <p>Urban dereliction is a major problem within the Atlanta community. It is the result of unequally distributed wealth and 
                                    poor environmental standards which cause properties to become unwanted and abandoned. This in turn lowers the property
                                    value of the communities and members within the communities are forced to live with uncollected trash and other hazardous waste. 
                                    These issues emanate from discrimination in policy making in regards to environmental standards. There is a clear 
                                    difference in the amount of trees and other plants in areas that have more white people than areas with more people of 
                                    color. That is, there are more trees in places with more white residences. With pollutants, the opposite is true where 
                                    we see people of color are in the same areas where dumps and waste facilities are located. It is evident that one of 
                                    the key issues is the amount of litter and illegal dumps found in these communities as 71% of surveyed people living in 
                                    neighborhoods with high dereliction said that the trash was a problem for their community. The same survey 
                                    was done with people living in areas with low levels of dereliction and only 20% reported trash as an issue for their 
                                    community. From this, there is a connection between how waste is managed in comparison the demographics of the area, which shows 
                                    the ongoing environmental injustice occurring in Atlanta.

                                <p>In Atlanta, environmental injustices from the 1980s are still plaguing the community, and the rivers around it are living proof 
                                    of that. In 2010, the river at Panola Shoals was deemed unfit for people to swim in due to the amount of pollution in the river. 
                                    It was found to be full of sewage waste and trash which puts communities around it at risk of dangerous diseases. This river was 
                                    used as an outlet for sewage and other hazardous wastes for facilities from the mid 1900s. This same river also flows through many 
                                    majority black communities and posed even more of a risk then before reforms were put into place to reduce the pollution going into 
                                    it. Nevertheless, the origins of this river’s drastically low health standards are the result of racial discrimination and a lack of 
                                    efficacy in the political decision making which created these waste paths. When the EPA became involved in 1998, Atlanta was required 
                                    to fix the overflows of sewage and trash created by the river costing over $4 billion dollars. In the decree, however, only $25 million 
                                    dollars needed to be spent on communities with larger populations of minorities and it simply stated that there must be “particular 
                                    emphasis... placed on input from minority communities adjacent to the designated streams and other streams affected by the discharges 
                                    from the Defendant’s CSO control facilities.” This decree in practice did very little to rectify the issues of environmental injustice seen 
                                    in the Atlanta rivers and the river’s current state is proof of that. It is clear that waste management and race are connected and minorities 
                                    are typically used as scapegoats for the pollution placed in their communities.
