            <h2>Air Polution in Atlanta</h2>
            <a href="https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2011/communities-of-color-poverty-bear-burden-of-air-pollution">Original Article</a>
            <div class='long-text'>
                Air pollution is a large issue for many citizens around Atlanta and throughout all of Georgia that live below the poverty line. 
                Toxic gasses from coal fired power plants are produced all over EPA region 4, which includes Georgia. African American communities 
                also suffer disproportionately from this issue. In 2011, the EPA proposed a plan to cut down on allowed toxic emissions from coal 
                powered plants from all over the state. It is estimated that an african american community in Georgia was 30% more likely to be 
                affected by a coal plantâ€™s toxins than any other community. It was estimated that this plan would save 17,000 lives and prevent over 
                100,000 cases of asthma. The expected value of these improvements yearly was around 100 billion a year. To put this in perspective, 
                this article states that for every dollar spent on this beneficial project, the average american citizen would see an increase of around 
                10$ in health benefits. This movement has been extraordinarily helpful to Georgians and people living in the Atlanta area since Georgia 
                is one of the top 5 states in number of coal based power plants near low income communities. New limitations on power plant location have 
                also been established. New factories must be built a certain distance away from any community to safeguard their health. This event can be 
                seen as a great win for champions of environmental justice. Because they brought this problem to the center stage, new laws have been 
                created to help them and protect the right of every person to equal health.
